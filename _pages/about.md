About Me
======

I earned my master's in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, where I was advised by [Prof. Zheng Song](https://umdearborn.edu/people-um-dearborn/zheng-song), focusing on WiFi sensing and distributed computing for future mobility. Previously, I worked on multilingual font interpolation with [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and [Prof. Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io),  As a Project JRF at IIIT Chennai with [Prof. V. Masilamani](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/people/faculty/masila@iiitdm.ac.in), I developed desktop and web tools for detecting multimodal deepfake content to combat cybercrime.
