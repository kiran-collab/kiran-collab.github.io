About Me
======

I have been a  master's student at University of Michigan in the Computer Science department. Advised by [Prof. Zheng Song](https://umdearborn.edu/people-um-dearborn/zheng-song) at University of Michigan Dearborn, I focused on developing system based solutions for usecases utilizing Wifi Sensing and Distributed Computing based solutions for Future Mobility. Previously I was advised by [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and [Prof. Vinay Namboodri](https://vinaypn.github.io) where I focused on Font Interpolation in multi linguistic setting.
I spent fruitful time at IIIT Chennai as Project JRF, advised by [Prof. V Masilamani](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/people/faculty/masila@iiitdm.ac.in), in which our team designed and developed desktop and web tools for preventing obscene image related cyber crimes.
